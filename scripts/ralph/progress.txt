## Codebase Patterns
- next-intl v4 uses `requestLocale` (not `locale`) in getRequestConfig - must await it
- Middleware matcher pattern: `'/(vi|en)/:path*'` for locale routes
- Messages JSON files go in `/messages` directory at project root
- Translation keys use nested structure (e.g., `admin.events.title`) - access via `t('admin.events.title')` or `t('title')` with namespace
- Escape quotes in JSX: `&apos;` for apostrophes, `&quot;` for double quotes
- Locale layout uses `await params` pattern (Next.js 15 style): `const { locale } = await params;`
- Root layout remains minimal (html/body only), providers go in locale layout
- SSG: `generateStaticParams` in layout propagates to all child pages - no need to add it to each page

- Installed next-intl package (v4.7.0)
- Created src/i18n.ts with getRequestConfig for locale handling
- Created src/middleware.ts for locale detection and routing
- Updated next.config.js with next-intl plugin wrapper
- Created /messages/en.json and /messages/vi.json (placeholder content for US-002)
- Added .eslintrc.json with next/core-web-vitals config
- Files changed: package.json, package-lock.json, next.config.js, src/i18n.ts, src/middleware.ts, messages/en.json, messages/vi.json, .eslintrc.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - next-intl v4 API: use `requestLocale` instead of `locale` in getRequestConfig callback
  - Must await requestLocale before using it
  - Plugin pattern: `withNextIntl(nextConfig)` wraps the config

- Extracted all 100+ translations from LanguageContext.tsx into JSON files
- Created complete /messages/en.json with nested structure (church, navigation, hero, welcome, ministries, stories, events, contact, footer, admin)
- Created complete /messages/vi.json with matching structure
- Fixed pre-existing ESLint errors (unescaped quotes/apostrophes in JSX)
- Files changed: messages/en.json, messages/vi.json, ContactForm.tsx, Welcome.tsx, ClassesList.tsx, LocationsList.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Translation keys use nested structure (e.g., `admin.events.title`) not flat dot notation
  - Must escape quotes in JSX: use `&apos;` for apostrophes, `&quot;` for double quotes

- Created src/app/[locale]/ directory structure
- Moved page.tsx, login/, admin/, blog/, unauthorized/ to [locale]
- Created src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx with NextIntlClientProvider and locale handling
- Updated root layout.tsx to be minimal (no providers - they moved to locale layout)
- Files changed: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx, plus all moved pages
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - No privacy page existed (PRD acceptance criteria mentioned it but it wasn't there)
  - Locale layout params use Promise pattern: `params: Promise<{ locale: string }>` and must `await params`
  - NextIntlClientProvider wraps client components for translations to work

- Verified SSG is already working from US-003 implementation
- `generateStaticParams` in [locale]/layout.tsx handles both locales
- Build output shows ● (SSG) for all routes: /en, /vi, /en/admin, etc.
- No code changes needed - functionality was pre-existing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` only works in Server Components, not 'use client' files
  - SSG happens automatically when generateStaticParams is defined in layout
  - Client components can still be SSG - they're pre-rendered and hydrated
